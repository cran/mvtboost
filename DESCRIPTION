Description: Fits a multivariate model of decision trees for multiple,
    continuous outcome variables. A model for each outcome variable is fit
    separately, selecting predictors that explain that explain covariance in
    multiple outcomes. Package is built on top of 'gbm', which fits an ensemble
    of decision trees to univariate outcomes.
